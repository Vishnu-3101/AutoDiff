# AutoGrad

An implementation of Automatic Differentiation from scratch.

- This helps understand how differentiation of complex functions is performed in libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow.
- It uses the concepts of Operator overloading and Topological sort.

`The current implementation supports only multiplication and addition operators. More operators will be added further.`
